# Part 3 - Microsoft Azure

Welcome to the third and final part of Phase 2 Data Science! This part will involve you doing (almost) everything you've done in the first two parts in the cloud! 

Microsoft's cloud computing platform is called Azure and this part will specifically focus on Azure Machine Learning, a service within Azure that allows you to do everything from running Jupyter notebooks and training machine learning models in the cloud to logging evaluation metrics across multiple iterations of model development and deploying models from within the Azure Portal (i.e. the website you'll use to access Azure from your web browser) or from your own code.

We hope you find that doing data science in the cloud makes several things easier and faster to accomplish while unlocking some useful features that can help you as a data scientist deliver more value in less time! The features within Azure Machine Learning that this part will focus on are:

- **Notebooks** for saving and executing Jupyter notebooks
- **AutoML** to automatically train and tune models
- **Runs** to track metrics like precision, recall, ROC, AUC etc.
- **Model deployment** using Docker containers from both the Azure Portal and from your IDE into Azure

## Getting Started

Before starting the tasks below, you will need to sign up for an Azure for Students subscription using your institution email. This will give you $100 credit and free services to use within 12 months of signing up. After you use your credit, wait until the 12 months are over and sign up again if youâ€™re still a student. You'll get $100 credit and free services just like before.

If you do not have an Azure account using your institution email:
1. Go to [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students) and click **Start for free**
2. Sign in using your institution email
    - If you are based at the University of Auckland, your university email is already associated with a Microsoft account so do not create a new account using your university email, simply sign in.
    - If you are based at a different institution, check whether your institution has already provided you with a Microsoft account by trying to sign in first (if that doesn't work, create a new account using your institution email)
2. Follow the prompts to verify your academic status

If you already have an Azure account using your institution email:
1. Sign in to [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students)
2. You will most likely be shown how much credit you have remaining and when your Azure for Students subscription expires if it has not expired yet, or prompted to renew if it has expired.

After you have completed the steps above, you should be directed to the [Education page of the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?Microsoft_Azure_Education_correlationId=e940c73ae3ec44b1852cb836987cef3e#view/Microsoft_Azure_Education/EducationMenuBlade/~/overview) - this is where you can see how much credit you have remaining, how many days until your Azure for Students subscription expires, and other helpful resources. Please see [the FAQs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/education-hub/azure-dev-tools-teaching/program-faq#azure-for-students) regarding eligibility requirements and more useful information about Azure for Students.

## Tips

- Keep an eye on your Azure spending! For all of the tasks in this part, you will not be charged anything or any charges you do incur will come from your $100 credit because we have designed this part to only use services available within Azure for Students (which are either always free or cost some amount to use that will be taken from your credit). 
    - If you only use the services within Azure for Students, it will be extremely difficult for you to use up the entire $100 credit, but if your usage results in your credit being depleted to $0, you won't be able to get more credit until your Azure for Students subscription expires, and you'll have to move to [pay as you go](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/students/?WT.mc_id=academic-9938-cxa).
    - MSA is not responsible for and will not refund or cancel any costs you personally incur due to services that you use.
